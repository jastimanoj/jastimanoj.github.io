                    If you are thinking about filing a claim for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or if your claims for either or both of these disability programs have been denied, a knowledgeable, experienced Social Security Disability lawyer can help you put forward the strongest case possible to the Social Security Administration to get your case approved so you can obtain cash and medical insurance benefits.
                <br />
                    I am attorney Lakshmi Manoj Kumar Jasti, and I represent people who are unable to work due to illness or injury and need cash and medical benefits from the Social Security Administration. My clients live throughout eastern and south central Pennsylvania, especially in and near Philadelphia, Reading, south and central New Jersey, Delaware and southwestern Florida. I have more than 20 years of experience representing claimants for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and/or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.
                <br />
                    My office consists of me, the managing attorney, as well as an associate attorney who I have personally trained and support staff members who are very experienced in Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income claims. Together with my staff, I am dedicated to guiding your case successfully through the Social Security Disability system. I am personally involved in every case in the office, regardless as to which attorney handles the hearing.
                <br />
                    Using thorough knowledge of the law, physical and mental illness and injury, necessary medications, diagnostic tests, and of the adjudicators and administrative law judges, I efficiently and effectively pursue claims for Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income benefits.
                <br />
                    My substantial medical and legal knowledge assists people throughout the SSDI and SSI application and appeals processes, helping them tackle the difficult task of proving their disabilities due to physical or mental illnesses or injuries.
